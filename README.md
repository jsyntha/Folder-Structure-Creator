# Folder-Structure-Creator

This program creates a folder structure in your Downloads folder, or removes any empty folders inside it.

How to use:

- Add your folder paths to the vector on line 12 in the code.
- Run the program.
- Enter 1 to create the folders.
- Enter 2 to delete any empty folders.

It only works inside the Downloads folder as of now and wonâ€™t affect anything else.
